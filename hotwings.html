<h1>Hot Wings</h1>

<h2>These hotwings are pretty much almost impossible to eat.</h2>
<p>
I like making these painful hotwings in the air fryer. they give them a restaurant style crispiness to
the skin without having to use breading. the seasonings are to keep the pepper cravings at bay.
In fact, i usually don't want anything spicy for multiple days after these wings.
